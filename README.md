# Structure-Data-Extraction

Project Purpose:

We use Xpath to extract structured data from transactional emails of various types -- travel reservations, online order confirmations, utility bills, etc.

We write small functions to modify the data retrieved by the XPATH. Either to make it presentable or to make it comply with the data types required.
